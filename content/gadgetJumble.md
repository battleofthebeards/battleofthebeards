As part of our day of beardy fun, we're hoping that all the attending beards will bring along unwanted tech for a gadget jumble

## In Brief

To help raise more money for CALM, we'd like to be able to sell on unwanted tech from the beards who are attending

## The Whole Nine Yards

If you have any unwanted tech gadgets that you'd like to see go to a grateful home, or to be cannibalised into some world dominating techno-beast, then bring them along!

We'd like to take the opportunity to help you de-clutter your man (or woman) caves of those pieces of tech that you still haven't found a use for, even after all this time.
Come on, you now you had a good reason for buying that veeblefetzer to interface to the doohickey, but you never have the time do you?
Make a clean break with all your (useable and functional) detritus and use it to raise money for this great cause, with all money raised from the sales will go to the supported charity.
Don't forget though, even if you've donated items, you can still buy other shiny-shiny tech from our helpful volunteers!

All we ask is that items are NOT in a dangewrous state and that the lucky purchasers don't expect any kind of warrantee. Donations accepted on the day at the Bierkeller and you'll be able to purchase throughout the day.
