description: I would like to discuss the feasibility of generating a data visualisation that would help inspire us all (men & women) to change any possible bad habits we have in a more positive direction. I am envisioning a visualisation that would allows us to explore the effects our habits are having on our life expectancy and would allow us to identify what change would bring the greatest benefit. Some parts of this will be coded in advance using R.
