description: Deciding to adopt an Agile way of working is great! Being precious about the agile framework you decide to use is not. For one reason or another, since adopting Agile, we've become a community of obsessive practitioners who seem unable to take a pragmatic approach to making project or process decisions. <br> Never has such a sense of entitlement been seen in project teams than in those who have recently converted to Agile. 'Agile experts' have constantly told teams that to get any value, you take an all or nothing approach towards implementation such as Scrum. Belittling all previous process ideas, Agile culture can sometimes be toxic and can turn the development team against the business if not properly facilitated. <br>In this session, we'll explore how an Agile transition is never an overnight job and that to succeed in any type of project delivery, pragmatism is still a vital ingredient. Having a vision to be better with Agile is crucial, but so is an understanding that it will take time, it will be disruptive, and it should be pragmatic.
