description: Whether we like it or not, we are all going to die. I would like to propose exploring rather than ignore this... I would like to use R to explore the likelihood of this happening during 2017. Some relevant factors include age, current health conditions and our lifestyle. By bringing these topics and relevant data together we can have a realistic version of what we should do during 2017 and learn a little about using R at the same time. I will attempt to make the topic funny...
